In Spring 2019 I worked on a class project with 5 other students.
  The project was on comparing book reviews and related movie reviews for the movie based on the book.
  It involved web scraping, APIs, text analysis, and visualization using Qlik.
  I used the python library gensim to do Latent Direchlet Analysis which created a set of topics to describe the review corpus.

This is a project I did to analyze UN voting data to find clusters of voting.  I calculated the distance between the votes and scaled it to two dimensions in order to study the clusters.
